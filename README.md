## QuadTree implementation in C

This code was originally authored by a Stackoverflow user `dragon-energy` (referred to as the author) and posted under following page:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41946007/efficient-and-well-explained-implementation-of-a-quadtree-for-2d-collision-det

This post also features an extensive explanation of a QuadTree data structure and selected alternatives, as well as describes the approach taken in this very implementation.
 
Minor modifications include:
- organization of the code into files,
- float-to-int type change,
- a header addition,
- a bug fix as mentioned by myself in the very same question page linked above.
